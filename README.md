A simple Strapi plugin to add navgation controls to the edit page of an item of collection without going back to the collection page.

## Caveat

Please note this plugin depends a lot on the pre-existing DOM structure of the Strapi admin panel, as there is currently no injection zone available for the specific area I want to place the navigation control (as of Strapi v4.3.6). So please use with caution!

## Feature

- Add a **Previous** and **Next** button to navigate forward and backward of a collection by id
- Add a **Back to collection** button to go back to collection view (as the default back button is only browser back button)

## Rebuild The Admin Panel

New releases can introduce changes to the administration panel that require a rebuild. Rebuild the admin panel with one of the following commands:

yarn build
```

or

```
npm run build
```

# Usage

Once the plugin is installed and setup, the functionalities are accessible on the content management page of items of a collection.
